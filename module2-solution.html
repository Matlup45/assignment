            There are a number of reasons you may need a block of text and when you do, a random paragraph can be the perfect solution. If you happen to be a web designer and you need some random text to show in your layout, a random paragraph can be an excellent way to do this. If you're a programmer and you need random text to test the program, using these paragraphs can be the perfect way to do this. Anyone who's in search of realistic text for a project can use one or more of these random paragraphs to fill their need

          For writers looking for a way to get their creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph can be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this tool is that nobody knows what is going to appear in the paragraph. This can be leveraged in a few different ways to force the writer to use creativity. For example, the random paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph of a story that the writer must finish. I can also be used as a paragraph somewhere inside a short story

      <div class="item">

        <h3>Mobile</h3>
      </div>

        For some writers, it isn't getting the original words on paper that's the challenge, but rewriting the first and second drafts. Using the random paragraph generator can be a good way to get into a rewriting routine before beginning the project. In this case, you take the random paragraph and rewrite it so it retains the same meaning, but does so in a better and more concise way. Beginning the day doing this with a random paragraph can make the rewriting of an article, short story, or chapter of a book much easier than trying to begin directly with it.
